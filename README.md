# Initial React-Native Project

Just a boilerplate to get started using some installed libraries:
- babel module resolver
- styled components
- eslint
- typescript
- typescript eslint parser 

## Features

I implemented some features to help get started
- default work tree with ./src
- utils folder with useSizing hook that implements Dimensions from React Native
- Hello screen 
- Hello functional component
